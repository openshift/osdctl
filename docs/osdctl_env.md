## osdctl env

Create an environment to interact with a cluster

### Synopsis


Creates an isolated environment where you can interact with a cluster.
The environment is set up in a dedicated folder in $HOME/.ocenv.
The $CLUSTERID variable will be populated with the external ID of the cluster you're logged in to.

*PS1*
osdctl env renders the required PS1 function 'kube_ps1' to use when logged in to a cluster.
You need to include it inside your .bashrc or .bash_profile by adding a snippet like the following:

export PS1='...other information for your PS1... $(kube_ps1) \$ '

e.g.

export PS1='\[\033[36m\]\u\[\033[m\]@\[\033[32m\]\h:\[\033[33;1m\]\w\[\033[m\]$(kube_ps1) \$ '

osdctl env creates a new ocm and kube config so you can log in to different environments at the same time.
When initialized, osdctl env will copy the ocm config you're currently using.

*Logging in to the cluster*

To log in to a cluster within the environment using backplane, osdctl creates the ocb command.
The ocb command is created in the bin directory in the environment folder and added to the PATH when inside the environment.


```
osdctl env [flags] [env-alias]
